import './Post.css';

// Within the “Post” component create a template of how you would like each individual post to be displayed. This will include the user’s name, the body of the post, and the “like” and “dislike” buttons. For now, do not worry about the functionality for the “like” and “dislike” buttons – just decide where and how you would like them to display on each individual post!
